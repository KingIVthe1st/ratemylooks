```bash
# Replace with fixed version
cp js/main-fixed.js js/main.js
```

### Step 3: Verify Deployment
1. Open the website in a browser
2. Navigate to upload section
3. Click upload area multiple times rapidly
4. Verify no console errors or infinite loops
5. Test file upload functionality works correctly

### Step 4: Monitor for Issues

## üß™ POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING

### Critical Test Cases:
1. **Single Click Test**: Click upload area once ‚Üí Should open file dialog
2. **Rapid Click Test**: Click upload area 10 times quickly ‚Üí Should be handled gracefully
3. **File Selection Test**: Select a file ‚Üí Should show preview and enable button
4. **Remove File Test**: Remove selected file ‚Üí Should return to upload state
5. **Mobile Touch Test**: Touch upload area on mobile ‚Üí Should work without loops

### Success Criteria:
- ‚úÖ No infinite console logs
- ‚úÖ No browser freezing or high CPU usage
- ‚úÖ File upload works smoothly
- ‚úÖ All user interactions are responsive
- ‚úÖ No JavaScript errors in console

## üö® ROLLBACK PLAN

If issues are detected after deployment:

### Immediate Rollback:
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp js/main.js.backup.YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS js/main.js
```

### Alternative Rollback:
1. Access the Git repository
2. Revert to the last working commit before the infinite loop issue
3. Deploy the previous stable version
